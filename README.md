# Big2

Tools/Frameworks: This game is built using the Applet framework. I used the java.awt.* to import my own choice of pictures to enhance the game graphics. I also used sun.audio library to play music in the background. 

Reflection: This was a fairly ambitious project as I required 80+ hours to finish. I had a tremendous amount of fun making the game, especially when I got to play against my own built AI :)
